# Claude Code Session Management Commands

Custom slash commands for Claude Code that provide comprehensive development session tracking and documentation. Based on [Claude Code's custom slash command system](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands).

## üéØ Overview

This is a set of custom slash commands for Claude Code that helps developers maintain continuity across multiple coding sessions with Claude by:

- **Documenting Progress**: Capture what was done, how it was done, and why decisions were made
- **Tracking Changes**: Monitor git changes, todo items, and implementation details  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable future sessions to understand past work without re-analyzing the entire codebase
- **Issue Resolution**: Document problems encountered and their solutions for future reference

These commands extend Claude Code's built-in functionality with project-specific session management capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Session Management
```bash
# Start a new session (with optional name)
/project:session-start authentication-refactor
# Or without a name
/project:session-start

# Resume an existing unfinished session
/project:session-resume

# Update progress during development (with optional notes)
/project:session-update Implemented OAuth with Google
# Or without notes (auto-summarizes recent activity)
/project:session-update

# End session with comprehensive summary
/project:session-end

# View current session status
/project:session-current

# List all past sessions
/project:session-list
```

### GitHub Issue Management
```bash
# Create detailed bug reports from simple descriptions
/project:issue-bug Users getting logged out randomly
# Or prompt for description
/project:issue-bug

# Create detailed feature requests
/project:issue-feature Add dark mode support
# Or prompt for description  
/project:issue-feature

# List and select GitHub issues to work on
/project:issue-list
# With filtering
/project:issue-list --label=bug

# Create implementation plan for selected issue
/project:issue-plan 42
# Or prompt for issue ID
/project:issue-plan
```

### Git Workflow Integration
```bash
# Create git branch with smart naming from session context
/project:git-branch
# Or with custom name
/project:git-branch feature/user-profiles

# Create pull request with AI-generated description
/project:git-pr
# Or with custom title
/project:git-pr "Fix authentication timeout issues"

# Perform ultrathink PR review before merging
/project:git-review
# Or review specific PR
/project:git-review 42
```

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the folders to your project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:iannuttall/claude-sessions.git
   # Or copy the commands and sessions folders to your project root
   ```

2. Create the sessions tracking file:
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p sessions
   touch sessions/.current-session
   ```

3. Add to `.gitignore` if you don't want to track sessions:
   
   ```
   sessions/
   ```

## üìù How It Works

This system provides custom slash commands inspired by [Claude Code's custom slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) feature. While Claude Code typically looks for commands in `.claude/commands/`, this repository provides a standalone implementation with commands in the `commands/` directory.

- **Prefix**: All commands use the `/project:` prefix (for project-specific commands)
- **Arguments**: Commands support arguments using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder
- **Execution**: Claude reads the command file and executes the instructions within
- **Note**: These commands are designed to work with Claude but can be adapted for other AI coding assistants

## üéØ Best Practices for Claude Code

### Command Usage

- These commands work only within Claude Code interactive sessions
- Commands are project-specific and available to all team members
- Arguments are passed directly after the command name

### Session Management

- Sessions help Claude maintain context across conversations
- Review past sessions before starting related work
- Session files serve as documentation for your development process

## üîß Customization

### Adapting for Standard Claude Code Setup

If you want to use these with Claude Code's standard directory structure:

1. Copy the `commands` folder to `.claude/commands/` in your project
2. Update paths in command files from `sessions/` to `.claude/sessions/`

### Creating Your Own Commands

- Modify command files to change behavior
- Create additional session-related commands
- Organize commands in subdirectories for namespacing (e.g., `/project:session:feature:start`)
- Create personal versions in `~/.claude/commands/` with `/user:` prefix

2. **Decision History**: Understand why certain approaches were taken
3. **Issue Awareness**: Know about problems already encountered and solved
4. **Code Evolution**: Track how the codebase has changed over time
5. **Dependency Tracking**: Awareness of what packages and tools are used

## üîç Tips and Tricks

1. **Searchable Sessions**: Use consistent terminology in updates for easy searching
2. **Link Issues**: Reference ticket numbers or GitHub issues in updates
3. **Code Snippets**: Include important code changes in session updates
4. **Screenshots**: Reference screenshot paths for UI changes
5. **Testing Notes**: Document test scenarios and results

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customizing Commands

Edit the command files in `commands/` to:

- Change session file format
- Add custom sections
- Modify summary generation
